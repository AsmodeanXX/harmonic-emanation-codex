# The Harmonic Emanation Codex (HEC)
### A Unifying Framework for Human-Level Reality  
By **Joshua Crich**

The Harmonic Emanation Codex (HEC) is an open-source, integrative framework designed to help us understand reality — physical, mental, social, and meaningful — through one coherent structural lens.

HEC is based on three universal principles:

- **Symplokē** — Connection & adjacency  
- **Recurrence** — Repetition, pattern, & proto-time  
- **Ennoia** — Coherence, stability, & emergent meaning  

From these emerge the **Ten Aeons** (G0–G9), describing how the universe forms:

- matter & space  
- identity & consciousness  
- meaning & society  
- universal coherence  

HEC is not a doctrine; it is a lens for exploring the structure of reality.  
It is meant for **scientists, thinkers, dreamers, and especially my children**, to give them a window into how I understood the world.
