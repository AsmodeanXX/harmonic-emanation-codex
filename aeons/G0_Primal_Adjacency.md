# G0 — Primal Adjacency  
### *The First Spark of Connection*  
_By Joshua Crich_

---

## Overview

G0 is the foundational layer of the Aeonic Ladder.  
It describes the first condition required for reality to exist in the Harmonic Emanation Codex:

> **Connection without structure.  
> Contact without geometry.  
> Relation without direction or time.**

G0 contains no space, no time, no matter, and no identity.  
It is the beginning of **Symplokē** — pure adjacency.

## Key Characteristics of G0

- No space  
- No time  
- No geometry  
- No matter  
- No boundaries  
- No identity  
- No dynamics  
- No meaning  

Only:

- **nodes** (pre-physical units)  
- **connections** between them  
- **the capacity for structure**

G0 is the “zero level” of emergence:  
structure before form.

## Symplokē at G0

Symplokē is the insight that:

> **Everything exists because it touches something else.**

At G0, this appears as:

- raw adjacency  
- potential links  
- no distances  
- no shape  
- no orientation  

Just the possibility of connection.

## Why G0 Matters

All later Aeons depend on G0:

- space requires connection  
- matter requires patterns  
- identity requires boundaries  
- consciousness requires continuity  
- meaning requires relationships  

G0 is the root of all emergence.

## G0 in Simple Terms

If reality were a fabric:

- **G0 is the thread**  
- alone  
- unpatterned  
- unwoven  
- without direction  

Pure material without structure.

---

## G0 in Scientific Terms

G0 corresponds to a pre-geometric substrate:

- nodes = primitive relational units  
- edges = adjacency potentials  
- no metric  
- no temporal ordering  
- no spectral modes  

A raw relational field.

---

## Transition to G1

G0 transitions to **G1** when:

- connections begin forming patterns  
- recurrence activates  
- structure becomes meaningful  

This is the universe’s first act of organization.

## Summary

| Property | G0 Description |
|---------|----------------|
| **Name** | Primal Adjacency |
| **Emergence** | Pure relational contact |
| **What Exists** | Nodes + adjacency |
| **What Does Not** | Time, space, form, identity |
| **Guiding Principle** | Symplokē |
| **Role** | Foundation of all higher Aeons |

## Essence of G0

> **G0 is the raw relational web from which all of reality will eventually unfold.**
