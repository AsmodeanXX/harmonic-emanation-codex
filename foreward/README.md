# Foreword  
### Letters & Personal Reflections from the Author

This folder contains the personal heart of the Harmonic Emanation Codex.

- **letter_to_my_children.md** — The dedication and message from creator Joshua Crich to his children:  
  *Christopher, Beatrix, Bernadette, Obadiah, and Hazel.*

This section preserves the original intention behind HEC:  
a gift, a legacy, and a window into how the author understood reality.

These writings are optional for scientific readers but essential for understanding the *human origin* of the Codex.
