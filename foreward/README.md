# harmonic-emanation-codex
The Harmonic Emanation Codex is an open-source framework that unifies physics, consciousness, meaning, and human experience into a single coherent worldview. It is not science, not metaphysics, not mysticism — but a human-level model of how reality coherently emerges, stabilizes, and becomes meaningful.
