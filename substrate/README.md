# The Triaxial Substrate  
### Symplokē • Recurrence • Ennoia

This folder explains the **three foundational principles** of HEC:

- **Symplokē** — relational adjacency  
- **Recurrence** — pattern, cycles, proto-time  
- **Ennoia** — stability, selection, meaning  

These files define the substrate from which all Ten Aeons (G0–G9) emerge.
